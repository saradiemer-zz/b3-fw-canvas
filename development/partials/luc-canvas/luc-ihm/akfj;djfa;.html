			<p class="body intro">To honor the eight Salvadoran martyrs, Loyola built a memorial on campus in 2010. The structure, which curves along the sidewalk on the northwest side of Madonna della Strada Chapel, contains the names of each of the victims. These are the stories behind those names.</p>

								     <p><span class="explainer light maroon m-l-05">Born: November 7, 1942, in Spain</span> A social psychologist and philosopher, Martín-Baró was a preeminent figure in the intellectual community. He studied theology in Europe and taught briefly at the University of Central America (UCA) before getting his doctorate in psychology from the University of Chicago.   •   After receiving his doctorate, Martín-Baró returned to UCA. In 1981 he assumed the position of academic vice-rector and was also the head of the Psychology Department, where he taught about the psychology of liberation. Called "Padre Nacho" by his rural congregation, Martín-Baró founded UCA's Institute of Public Opinion, which measured popular opinion about the civil war.   •   The night before his assassination, Martín-Baró spoke on the phone with his sister, who asked him if the war would end soon. His response? "A lot more people will have to die yet. A lot more people will have to die."</p>

He entered the Society of Jesus in 1952 and would go on to study philosophy and classical humanities—and ultimately earn a doctorate in theology in France.   •   López returned to El Salvador to teach for a few years at the University of Central America before moving to Nicaragua.

In his final years at UCA, he oversaw the campus's buildings and vegetable gardens.   •   Beyond the walls of UCA, López was the pastor of Tierra Virgen in the community of Soyapango. He also was an advocate for the nationwide literacy campaign headed by Fernando Cardenal, S.J., that reached hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans.</p>

He would go on to study classical language, humanities, and philosophy in Ecuador before completing his doctoral studies in Spain. He also received an honorary degree from Loyola in 1986, just three years before he was murdered.   •   Ellacuría, who was the rector of the University of Central America, was a proponent of liberation theology and one of the loudest advocates for peace negotiations during El Salvador's civil war. He acted as an informal mediator between the guerrilla fighting forces Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN) and the Salvadoran government, which made him an enemy of the far right.   •   Despite several threats to his life, Ellacuría continued to work for peace and the rights of innocent Salvadorans until his death.</p>

He entered the Society of Jesus in 1950 at the age of 17 and completed his novitiate at Santa Tecla, El Salvador, in 1951.   •   Over the next several years Montes taught physics, studied in Austria, and earned a doctorate in social anthropology in Spain. He returned to El Salvador in 1978 to become the chair of the Sociology Department at the University of Central America.   •   Like Ellacuría, Montes was a staunch advocate for the poor—and as such, he became a target of the political right. After "Death to the Communists of UCA" was painted on his car, Montes was asked about his safety. He simply said: "If they kill me, they kill me."</p>

Despite poor health, López dedicated much of his time and energy to the organization until his death at age 71.</p>
